lon tenpo pona la, jan lawa mije li lon.
ona li wile wan olin e jan lawa meli.
taso, jan meli ni li lawa lon ala la, mije lawa li olin ala e ona. <!-- lawa lon ala/not royal, lawa lon/true royal. lawa is indeterminate -->
mije lawa li tawa ma ale, li alasa e meli pi lawa lon! <!-- originally was 'alasa lukin' then 'lukin alasa'; specifying 'attempting' isn't necessary imo -->
taso, lon ma ale la, mije lawa li ken ala alasa e meli pi lawa lon.
jan lawa meli li lon ma ale!
taso, mije lawa li sona ala e ni:
meli ni li lawa lon anu seme? <!-- originally was lon ala lon, this is cleaner imo -->
mije lawa li lukin e meli la, ona li lukin e meli pi lawa lon ala. <!-- prefer pronoun then full name, or vice versa? -->
tan ni la, mije lawa li pini e alasa, li tawa tomo ona, li pilin ike. <!-- added detail: quit searching -->
ona li wile e meli pi lawa lon.

> One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the
> rain poured down in torrents.

lon tenpo pimeja kama la, telo ike mute li kama! <!-- a future night/one evening; "tenpo pimeja wan" is calque-y and weird -->
sewi li suno wawa, li kalama suli, li pana e telo mute mute.

> Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.

lon lupa pi tomo suli la, kalama li kama!
jan lawa majuna li open e lupa.

<!-- I'm gonna pretend the king doesn't exist. All he does is open the door. -->

> It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious!
> what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from
> her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at
> the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.

lon sinpin lupa pi tomo suli la, jan lawa meli li lon!
taso, telo mute en kon wawa li ike e ona.
linja ona en len ona li jo e telo mute.
len noka ona li jo e telo mute mute!
kin la, monsi pi len noka ona li pana e telo a!
taso, ona li toki e ni: "mi jan lawa meli. mi lawa lon."

<!-- my favorite paragraph tbh -->

> "Well, we’ll soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she said nothing,
> went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on
> the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then
> twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.

majuna lawa li toki insa e ni: "ni li lon ala. meli ni li lawa lon ala!"
taso, majuna lawa li toki ala.
ona li tawa tomo lape, li weka e len lape tan supa lape.
kin la, majuna lawa li pana e kili lili tawa ona! <!-- supa lape becomes ona -->
ona li pana e len supa lape mute mute lon kili lili, lon supa lape.

> On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how
> she had slept.

lon tenpo pimeja ale la, meli lawa li lape lon supa lape ni.
lon open pi tenpo suno la, majuna lawa li wile sona e ni: "lape sina li pona ala pona?"

> "Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven
> only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am
> black and blue all over my body. It’s horrible!"

meli lawa li toki: "lape mi li pona ala!
lon tenpo pimeja ale la, mi ken ala lape!
oko mi li pilin ike.
mi sona ala e nasin pi ike mi.
mi sona ala e ike pi supa lape.
taso, mi lape lon ijo kiwen ike.
ijo ni li ike e sijelo mi.
mi pilin ike mute tan ni."

> Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right
> through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.

tan toki ona la, majuna en mije li sona e ni:
meli li pilin e kili lili, li lawa lon!

> Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.

jan ante li ken ala pilin e kili lili lon anpa pi supa lape mute mute.
taso, jan meli pi lawa lon li ken!

> So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real
> princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no
> one has stolen or eaten it.

jan lawa mije li sona e ni: meli ni li lawa lon!
tan ni la, jan lawa mije li wan olin e jan lawa meli. <!-- this gives me a
little appreciation for English's gender distinction in pronouns, cause i could
use them both at the same time without being ambiguous. ona li jan seme? mi
toki lon jan tu! but, this works pretty well still; juggling more context is
already a game toki pona plays -->
kin la, ona li pana e kili lili ni tawa tomo pi sona majuna.
jan li lanpan ala, li moku ala la, sina ken lukin e kili lili lon tomo ni!
