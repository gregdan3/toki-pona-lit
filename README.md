# toki pona lit
A collection of documents and literature I've translated into [Toki
Pona](https://tokipona.org/), the language of good.

My translation notes are in the raw markdown documents in HTML comments.
Comments below a line refer to that line. Comments above a line are meta. Texts
written exclusively in toki pona (toki pona taso) do not have comments.
