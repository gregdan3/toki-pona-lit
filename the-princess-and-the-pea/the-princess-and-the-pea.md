> Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she
would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one,
but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it
was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always
something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was
sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.

lon tenpo pona a, jan lawa mije li lon.
ona li wile olin wan e jan lawa meli.
taso, jan meli ona li lawa ala la, jan mije li olin ala e ona.
<!-- distinction: lawa ala/not royal/not real princess, and lawa lon/true royal/real princess-->
jan lawa mije li tawa ma ale, li alasa lukin e jan lawa meli!
taso, lon ma ale la jan lawa mije li ken ala alasa e meli pi lawa lon. <!-- pause -->
jan lawa meli li lon ma ale!
taso, jan lawa mije li sona ala e ni:
jan meli ona li lawa ala lawa?
jan meli la, jan lawa mije li lukin e jan meli pi lawa ala.
tan ni la, jan lawa mije li tawa tomo ona, li pilin ike.
jan lawa mije li wile e jan meli pi lawa lon.

> One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the
rain poured down in torrents.

<!-- a future night/one evening; "tenpo pimeja wan" is calque-y and weird -->
lon tenpo pimeja kama la, telo sewi pi ike mute li kama!
sewi li suno wawa, li kalama suli, li pana telo mute mute.

> Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.

lon lupa pi tomo suli la, kalama li kama!
jan lawa majuna li open e lupa.
<!-- I'm gonna pretend the king doesn't exist. All he does is open the door. -->

> It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious!
what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from
her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at
the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.

lon sinpin lupa pi tomo suli la, jan lawa meli li lon!
taso, telo mute en kon wawa li ike e lukin ona.
linja ona en len ona li jo e telo mute.
len noka ona li jo e telo mute mute!
kin la, monsi pi len noka ona li pana e telo a!
taso, ona li toki e ni: "mi jan lawa meli. mi lawa lon."

> "Well, we’ll soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she said nothing,
went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on
the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then
twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.

jan lawa majuna li toki insa e ni: "ni li lon ala. ona li lawa ala!"
taso, jan lawa majuna li toki ala.
ona li tawa tomo lape, li weka e len lape tan supa lape.
kin la, jan lawa majuna li pana e kili lili tawa supa lape!
ona li pana e len supa lape mute mute lon kili lili, lon supa lape.

> On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how
she had slept.

lon tenpo pimeja ale la, jan lawa meli li lape lon supa lape ni
lon open pi tenpo suno la, jan lawa majuna li wile sona e ni: "sina lape pona
ala pona?"

> "Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven
only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am
black and blue all over my body. It’s horrible!"

jan lawa meli li toki: "mi lape pona ala!"
"lon tenpo pimeja ale la, mi ken ala lape! oko mi li pilin ike.
mi sona ala e nasin pi ike mi, e ijo ike pi supa lape.
taso, mi lape lon ijo ike kiwen. sijelo mi li lukin ike, li pilin ike tan ni."

> Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right
through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.

tan ni la, jan lawa majuna en jan lawa mije li sona e ni:
jan lawa meli li pilin e kili lili, li lawa lon!

> Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.

jan ante li ken ala pilin e kili lili lon anpa pi len supa lape mute mute.
taso, jan pi lawa lon li ken!

> So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real
princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no
one has stolen or eaten it.

jan lawa mije li sona e ni: jan lawa meli li lawa lon!
tan ni la, jan lawa mije li olin wan e jan lawa meli.  <!-- this gives me a
little appreciation for English's gender distinction in pronouns, cause i could
use them both at the same time without being ambiguous. ona li jan seme? mi
toki lon jan tu! -->
kin la, kili lili ni li pana tawa tomo pi sona majuna.
jan ante li lanpan ala, li moku ala e kili lili la, sina ken lukin e kili lili!

> There, that is a true story.
